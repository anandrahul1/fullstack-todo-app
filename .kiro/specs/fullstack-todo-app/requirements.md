# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a complete fullstack Todo application with a Node.js Express backend providing CRUD API endpoints and a frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application will allow users to manage their todo items with full create, read, update, and delete functionality, including the ability to mark items as complete.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new todo items, so that I can track tasks I need to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a todo description and clicks "Add" THEN the system SHALL create a new todo item with a unique ID
2. WHEN a new todo is created THEN the system SHALL display it in the todo list immediately
3. WHEN the user submits an empty todo description THEN the system SHALL display an error message and not create the item
4. WHEN a todo is created THEN the system SHALL set its status to "incomplete" by default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my todo items, so that I can see what tasks I have pending and completed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the application THEN the system SHALL display all existing todo items
2. WHEN displaying todos THEN the system SHALL show the description, completion status, and creation date
3. WHEN displaying todos THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish between completed and incomplete items
4. WHEN there are no todos THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the list is empty

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing todo items, so that I can update task descriptions when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks an "Edit" button on a todo item THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing of the description
2. WHEN the user saves an edited todo THEN the system SHALL update the item with the new description
3. WHEN the user cancels editing THEN the system SHALL revert to the original description
4. WHEN the user tries to save an empty description THEN the system SHALL display an error and not update the item

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to mark todo items as complete or incomplete, so that I can track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a checkbox or toggle on an incomplete todo THEN the system SHALL mark it as complete
2. WHEN the user clicks a checkbox or toggle on a complete todo THEN the system SHALL mark it as incomplete
3. WHEN a todo is marked complete THEN the system SHALL visually indicate its completed state (strikethrough, different color, etc.)
4. WHEN the completion status changes THEN the system SHALL persist the change immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete todo items, so that I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a "Delete" button on a todo item THEN the system SHALL remove the item from the list
2. WHEN a todo is deleted THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
3. WHEN the user attempts to delete a todo THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before deletion
4. WHEN a todo is deleted THEN the system SHALL permanently remove it from storage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a RESTful API backend, so that the frontend can perform CRUD operations on todo data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API receives a GET request to /api/todos THEN the system SHALL return all todo items in JSON format
2. WHEN the API receives a POST request to /api/todos with valid data THEN the system SHALL create a new todo and return it
3. WHEN the API receives a PUT request to /api/todos/:id with valid data THEN the system SHALL update the specified todo
4. WHEN the API receives a DELETE request to /api/todos/:id THEN the system SHALL delete the specified todo
5. WHEN the API receives invalid data THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with status codes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to persist my data, so that my todos are saved between sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates, updates, or deletes todos THEN the system SHALL persist changes to storage
2. WHEN the user refreshes the page or reopens the application THEN the system SHALL load previously saved todos
3. WHEN the backend server restarts THEN the system SHALL retain all todo data
4. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
